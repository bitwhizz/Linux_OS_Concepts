1.wap which should  only consisting of the main function.at some point in the function call pthread_self and print the value.
2.wap that creates 2 threads, one that keeps printing hello and other that keeps printing world.
3.wap that creates a thread.pan an integer argument to this thread from the main function.the thread function should print this integer value after every one second in a never ending while loop.observe if the program continues running or dies after some time.(hint:dont use pthread_join anywhere)
4.Do the previous one while calling pthread_join from the main function and observe the output.
5.wap to create a thread.this newly created thread should join with itself.there must be a printf statement.after the pthread_join in the thread code.see if this printf is executed.
6.wap that creates 1 thread in the  joinable state and anthor thread in the detached state.from the main thread call pthread_join for both of these thread.make sure that the 2 threads are not running in a never ending while loop & each thread must return a value.
7.wap using pthread_cancel to cancel a different thread.
8.wap to kill the main thread and seeing that it is being killed.
